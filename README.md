# Module 5 Project
## In this project I am trying to analyze the provided data to check if customer will accept coupons or not 


### There are two files in this repository
#### 1.Readme.md
#### 2.project.ipynb


  Problem 1. Read in the coupons.csv file.
Solution : 
1. Used the pandas **read_csv** method to read the csv file provided as part of the Project and storing the data in the '**data**' object of type data frame.
2. Check the size of the dataset using **data.shape** method. It has 12684 rows and 26 columns
